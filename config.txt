#####     CONFIG.TXT (HOW TO USE THIS FILE)     #####
#
#	This is a configuration file used to set up the parameters of the simulation.
#	Any lines beginning with a "#" are ignored. All other lines must be definitions, i.e.:
#
#		some value name = 42
#
#	Spaces are allowed in the value names. Each line has a comment above it describing the
#	particular effect of the following configuration setting. Be sure to follow the
#	input restrictions in the [brackets], i.e.:
#
#		# [integer] only integer values are allowed for this setting
#		foo bar = 42
#
#   [integer] - any whole number
#   [percent] - a percentage number between 1 and 100, do not include the "%" sign!
#	[optionA/optionB/...] - options, choose any one listed. Be sure to type it exactly as show - spaces, captialization, punctuation, everything
#
#	You can add definitions here in any order.
#
#	While the entire simulator is released open source (see license.txt), this configuration
#	file is meant to allow non-programmers to experiment with the simulator. If you do make
#	any changes to the simulator such as adding parameters, it would be nice to make those
#	parameters loadable from this configuration file so that future non-programmers can use
#	it still.
#
#	Below are some basic descriptions of the mechanics of the simulator, and how some of
#	the above settings alter the behavior.

#####     BASIC PLAY     #####
#
#	Playing partners are the 4 adjacent neighbors in cardinal directions only
#	Cell 5 will play against cells 2, 4, 6, and 8, but not against 1, 3, 7, and 9
#	If the "infinite map" setting is turned on, the map will "wrap around"
#		i.e. cell 6 will play against cell 4 (along with 5, 3, and 9)

#####     CAPTURE     #####
#
#	A cell is captured when the score of its neighboring cell is greater than its
#	own score by the "capture threshold" amount. Lowering this number makes it easier
#	for strategies to win against others, and increasing it makes it more difficult.
#	If, in the same round, two or more neighbors gain more than the capture threshold,
#	and thus become eligible to capture the same cell, the neighboring cell with the
#	higher total score captures.
